# Module 1: ROS 2 Basics

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book! This module introduces you to the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that powers modern robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture (Nodes, Topics, Services)
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes using Python (rclpy)
- Work with ROS 2 messages, publishers, and subscribers
- Understand and create URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files for humanoid robots
- Set up and configure a ROS 2 development environment

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. **[ROS 2 Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md)** - Understanding the fundamental architecture of ROS 2
2. **[Python Control with rclpy](./rclpy-basics.md)** - Programming ROS 2 nodes in Python
3. **[URDF Basics for Humanoids](./urdf-basics.md)** - Representing robots in ROS 2
4. **[ROS 2 Humble Setup](./setup.md)** - Step-by-step installation and configuration guide
5. **[Architecture Diagrams](./diagrams.md)** - Visual representations of ROS 2 concepts

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic programming experience in Python
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Getting Started

Begin with the [ROS 2 Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md) section to understand the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 systems.
