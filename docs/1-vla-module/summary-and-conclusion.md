## Architecture Summary

The complete VLA pipeline follows this architecture:

```
[Voice Command] → [Whisper Processing] → [LLM Planning] → [ROS2 Execution] → [Robot Action]
       ↑                ↓                    ↓                 ↓                  ↓
[Audio Input] ← [Status Updates] ← [Context Data] ← [Perception] ← [Environment]
```

### Core Components:
- **Voice Processing Layer**: Handles audio capture, preprocessing, and Whisper integration
